Stack and Queue Implementation
 
Purpose
This Python program demonstrates the implementation of two basic data structures: Stack and Queue. It provides basic operations like adding elements, removing elements, peeking at the top/front, and displaying the contents of these structures. The program is implemented using a linked list approach.
How to Run the Program

Prerequisites: Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.
Execution:
Save the code in a file named stack_queue.py.
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where the file is saved.
Run the program using the command:
python stack_queue.py
Program Output:
The program will perform a series of operations on both the Stack and the Queue.
It will display the output of these operations, including the state of the stack and queue at different stages.
Operations Performed
Stack
Add (Push): Add elements to the top of the stack.
Remove (Pop): Remove the top element from the stack.
Peek: Print the value of the top element without removing it.
Show: Print all elements in the stack.
Check if Empty: Determine whether the stack is empty.
Queue
Add (Enqueue): Add elements to the rear of the queue.
Remove (Dequeue): Remove the front element from the queue.
Peek: Print the value of the front element without removing it.
Show: Print all elements in the queue.
Check if Empty: Determine whether the queue is empty.
Time Complexity
The time complexity for each operation is as follows:
Stack Operations
Add (Push): O(1)
Adding an element only involves updating pointers.
Remove (Pop): O(1)
Removing the top element is a constant-time operation.
Peek Top: O(1)
Viewing the top element is a simple pointer reference.
Check if Empty: O(1)
Checking if the stack is empty involves a single comparison.
